== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)
****
*Here are the tables that contain all the project constraints and their explanations.*

=== _Technical Constraints_

Previous architecture decisions that may impact the solution design.

|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| SOLID for a decentralized  architecture | One of the aims of 'Viade' is to be a decentralized app, so we need a decentralized  technology like SOLID
| React for presentation | We were told to use 'React' in our project
| Use of GitHub | Our project is going to be hosted on a GitHub repository
| Testing | We need to create tests so we can be sure that our project is correct and it is working like it has to work
|===

=== _Organizational Constraints_

The project's environment. It affects the developing process.
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| Time limit | We have to develop the project during our 'Architecture of Software' course, so we have less than 3 months
| Team members | Our team is formed by 5 software engineering students at 'Universidad de Oviedo' university, so we only can use our free time and course lessons to develop it (and we need to organize our free time so we can study others subjects)
| Course deadlines | We have 3 deadlines during our course and we need to accomplish the requirements of them during our project developing
|===

=== _Documentation Constraints_

Decisions about how to document our project.

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| Arc42 | We have to use 'Arc42' structure for our project documentation because it is clear, simple and effective and a common tool used in current companies
| Asciidoctor | We have to use 'Asciidoctor' to create our documentation
