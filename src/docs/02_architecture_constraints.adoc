|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| Time limit | We have to develop the project during our 'Architecture of Software' course, so we have less than 3 months
| Team members | Our team is formed by 4 software engineering students at 'Universidad de Oviedo' university, so we only can use our free time and course lessons to develop it (and we need to organize our free time so we can study others subjects)
| Course deadlines | We have 4 deadlines during our course and we need to accomplish the requirements of them during our project developing

=== _Documentation Constraints_

Decisions about how to document our project.

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| Arc42 | We have to use 'Arc42' structure for our project documentation because it is clear, simple and effective and a common tool used in current companies
| Asciidoctor | We have to use 'Asciidoctor' to create our documentation
