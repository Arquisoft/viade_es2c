*Level 3*

In viade we have a lot of components in the 3rd level that shoul be described, like the functionaliti of the parsers (when you read a route from the pod is the filewriter class the component that calls the parser, but when you write a route the parser calls the filewriter component), the classes that creates a route calls a parser so they can store the new routein the user's POD, the media is taken from the POD in the moment that the user wanto to see the route's details, etc
