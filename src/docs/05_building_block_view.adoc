| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| User | Person who requires the functionality of this application. Is the one who interacts with the application and give the orders.
| Viade | Decentralised route tracker. It interacts with the POD to store and load the routes, media, information about the user, etc
| SOLID POD | Decentralised store unit of the user data. Is the part that contains tha information Viade uses.

| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Viade | Decentralized route tracker.
| Components and containers | They describe the code to show the different parts of the application and ints functionality
|Parsers | They let the user import a created route from other app
| PODs | Where Viade obtains the routes information, media or user's data and where viade stores the routes and media created in their classes.
|User | Same user as the last level
| Routes in a non-turtle format | Viade can create a route to work with from a GEP or Geojson route and then create a turtle version to store it in the User's POD

Level 3::

ViaDe will have to be meant as a decentralised route tracker application, which will also have to implement several requirements such as services, models & any other needed component. SOLID is the decentralisation specification that the team is going to be following all over the project development.

Some essential technologies such as RDF, which coordinates the POD data, are going to be establishing the foundation of the project.
