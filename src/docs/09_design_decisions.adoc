|Decision|Pro|Con
| Minimalist style | It will be more usable and simple to distinguise the options | It maybe would look boring if we dont do it properly
| The timeline page will contain all user routes and all routes shared to the user.  | The user will be able to see all the routes at once | it can be difficult to find a route if there are many created and shared routes
| The profile will contain routes created by the user | More intuitive and organized for the user | We will have to contain all the data in an accesible POD
| The new route page will users starting and creating a new route with a map| Intuitive and usable | Markers cannot ben deleted
| The routes can be accessed from timeline in a popup | It reduces the loading time | It is not possible to open more than one route at the same time
