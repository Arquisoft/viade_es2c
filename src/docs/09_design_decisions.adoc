== Design Decisions

|Decision|Pro|Con
| sliding menu stile like most of mobile applications | It will be easier to use in a mobile app | We will have to use a special library and maybe we will need to change some working code
| Minimalist style | It will be more usable and simple to distinguise the options | It maybe would look boring if we dont do it properly
| The timeline page will contain all routes ordered by time | It will be easier for the user to find his routes and will be more usable | It would be hard to do in the code (we will have to work with dates)
| The profile will contain routes created by the user | More intuitive and organized for the user | We will have to contain all the data in an accesible POD
| The new route page will users starting and creating a new route | Intuitive and usable | We have to learn how to create a map that allows the user to do that

In a future we will update this section when we have more design decisions.
