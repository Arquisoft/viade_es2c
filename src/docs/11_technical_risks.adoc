== Risks and Technical Debts
This project had some risks that we could solve:

[options="header",cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
| Priority | Risk | Consequence | Possible Solution
|1| Not being used to the technology | Be slow at developing or make mistakes and waste time | Reading and learning about React, SOLID and RDF. We should do some tutorials and use the SOLID forum and gitter.
|2| First time forming a team | We didn't know how to work with each other so sometimes we didn't understand each other | Communication and interest
|===

At this moment, our risks are these:
[options="header",cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
| Priority | Risk | Consequence | Possible Solution
|1| Using a deprecated library | Impossibility of using new features | Find a new library or include new complementary library
|2| Using png instead of PlantUML | It is difficult to do changes of diagrams | Implement diagram in PlantUML
|3| Group of 4 students | At the start we were meant to be 6 persons, however now we are 4 and we need to work harder | Try to have more time for this subject and focus on the important parts of the application
|===

And right now we have some technical debts
[options="header",cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
| Priority | Technical debt | Description | Consecuence
|1| Some parsers don't use sparql | We have just find out how to use sparql to get the information from a turtle file but we didn0t have time to implement it in all the parsers for this deadline | The code is not elegant and can easily fail
|2| Groups were not implemented | We didn't have time to implement that functionality | It is no possible to share routes with more than one user at the same time
|3| Comments were not implemented | We didn't have time to implement that functionality | The user's can't add comments to the routes
|4| Our project lacks documentation | We didn't have time to document all the code | Some parts are hard to understand
|5| There are some bugs and error | We need time to improve the app | It can occur an error
|6| We need more security | We have to add more security to the code, now it is a little vulnerable | The user can see the code if it occurs an error
