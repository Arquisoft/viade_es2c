== Risks and Technical Debts

In this first demo, we have some technical debts:

* We have not implemented the use of gpx for the routes
* Our RDF structure it's simple
* We have created our demo using an app generator, so we still have to learn mode about the code and quit some extra lines
* We still don't fully understand cucumber
* We have put a "Route" link in the nav just for testing, we need to find the way of accesing using a button
* Some code is "poor done" and have to make it more elegant
* We have to do documentation in the code

| Priority | Risk | Consequence | Possible Solution
|1| Route loaded in timeline page | Application requires more resources | Separate map with route in other page
|2| Using a deprecated library | Impossibility of using new features | Find a new library or include new complementary library
|3| Using png instead of PlantUML | It is difficult to do changes of diagrams | Implement diagram in PlantUML

|Priority|Risk |Consequence | Possible Solution
| 1|Not being used to the technology | Be slow at developing or make mistakes and waste time | Reading and learning about React, SOLID and RDF. We should do some tutorials and use the SOLID forum and gitter.
|2| First time forming a team| We don't know how to work with each other so we may not understand each other and consume time or be uncomfortable | Communication and interest
|3|  Not having much time | We only have 3 months to create this app and just have the course hours and some free time that we need to organize with other subjects | Organization
