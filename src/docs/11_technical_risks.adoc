The project has hardly any risks in the usage scenario, but there are some risks contemplated:

|===
| Risk | Consequence | Possible Solution
| Limit the possibility of including videos and images in posts | Add only one of each (video and image) | Change the code to let the user add more media
| Use deprecated libraries | Implement new features can be impossible or quite tedious | Find new libraries or include new complementary libraries
|===

Actually, the technical debts are the following:

|===
| Priority | Technical Debt | Consequence | Possible Solution
| HIGH | Friend groups | It is not possible to share routes with more than one user at the same time | Create a service to share routes to groups
| MEDIUM | Comments spec | The comments doesnt follow the Viade specification | The user's cant see who posted a comment
| MEDIUM | Map markers | User cannot delete an marker from the map | Use another map API
| HIGH | Interoperability | Viade is not interoperable with other Viade's apps | Work more with ViadeEspec
| MEDIUM | Internationalization |We have some parts that are not correctly internationalized | have more time to fix it
| MEDIUM | Parsers | The parser that writes the turtle has the lines directly in the code and it's not elegant | Use ldflex or another library to create the triplets of turtle
| HIGH | Security | We have the queries directly in the code so we can suffer an SQLInjection | extract the query and add it to a protected file
